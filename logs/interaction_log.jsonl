{"timestamp": "2025-11-26T16:27:25.313639", "question": "What is encapsulation", "answer": "Encapsulation is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. This helps in hiding the internal state of an object and only allowing access to it through well-defined interfaces. For example, in a class representing a car, the speed attribute and methods to accelerate or brake would be encapsulated within the class to control access and manipulation of the speed data.", "first_guess": "", "onboarding_pref": "concise", "mode": "rag_llm"}

{"timestamp": "2025-11-26T17:02:31.134186", "question": "What is Inheritance", "answer": "Inheritance in JavaScript refers to the process by which an object can inherit properties and methods from another object. Every JavaScript object inherits from exactly one prototype object. When you look up a property on an object that doesn't have that property, its prototype is checked, then its prototype's prototype, and so on until one of the prototypes responds with the property or undefined is returned. This process allows objects to share behavior and functionality through a chain of prototypes.\n\nIn the context of JavaScript, inheritance can be achieved through prototype-based inheritance. This means that objects can inherit properties and methods from a prototype object. It is important to note that JavaScript does not have traditional classes like other class-based languages. The new keyword \"class\" introduced in ECMAScript version 6 (ES6) is syntactic sugar that makes prototype-based inheritance look and behave more like traditional classes.\n\nInheritance can be used carefully in JavaScript, as cleaner code can often be achieved by preferring composition over inheritance. In cases where a subclass won't take advantage of its parent's implementations, it might not deserve to be a subclass at all. In such cases, it is recommended to use composition and delegation rather than inheritance to avoid violating principles like the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).", "first_guess": "", "onboarding_pref": "detailed", "mode": "rag_llm"}

The introduction of the class keyword in ECMAScript version 6 (ES6) is syntactic sugar to make prototype-based inheritance look and behave more like traditional classes, but it does not introduce any new mechanisms into JavaScript.

{"timestamp": "2025-11-26T17:08:35.880819", "question": "what is polymorphism", "answer": "Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different ways. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means that a single method or function can operate on different types of objects, providing flexibility and reusability in code.\n\nThere are two main types of polymorphism: compile-time polymorphism (also known as method overloading) and runtime polymorphism (also known as method overriding). \n\n1. Compile-time polymorphism: This occurs when multiple methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters. The compiler determines which method to call based on the number and types of arguments passed to it. For example, in Java, method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.\n\n2. Runtime polymorphism: This occurs when a method in a subclass overrides a method in its superclass. When an object of the subclass is used to call the overridden method, the subclass method is executed instead of the superclass method. This allows for dynamic method binding at runtime. For example, in Java, you can create a superclass with a method and then override that method in a subclass to provide specific implementation.\n\nOverall, polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming that promotes code reusability, flexibility, and extensibility.", "first_guess": "", "onboarding_pref": "detailed", "mode": "rag_llm"}
